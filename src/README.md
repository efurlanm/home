# My Personal Notes

This repository: <https://github.com/efurlanm/home/>  
Automatic generated website: <https://efurlanm.github.io/home/>

Welcome to my random personal notes that I collect over time, on the most varied subjects, such as design and implementation of languages, theory, internals, computer architecture, machine learning, high performance processing, programming, cluster, containers, books, links, tips and tricks, curiosities and others. The intention of my notes is not to be as accurate as possible, nor is it to be comprehensive.

The website is generated from plain text formatting files called [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) available in the directories. The static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a tool used to convert these Markdown files into the web pages you see. Some of the Markdown files are described in the text, while others appear only as menu items. For Jupyter Notebook files, Markdown files are automatically generated and also appear in the menu. It is important to note that there are many other files in the repository that do not appear on the website itself. To see them all, you can browse the repository directly.

## Selected links

* [Dynamic Load-balancing](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/34776/000792718.pdf): A New Strategyfor Weather Forecast Models, by Rodrigues, E. R. - the thesis includes approaches such as compiler, processor, Thread, TLS, GDT, LDT, PAPI, Assembly, etc.
* [Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) - in-depth overview of compilers, which are programs that translate source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code, assembly code, or an intermediate code.
* [History of compiler construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction) - historical overview of the development of compilers from the early days of computer science to the modern era. It discusses key milestones, influential projects, and significant advancements in compiler technology over the years.

* [Threaded code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code) - programming technique where the code consists primarily of subroutine calls. 


## My self-hosted webserver

* [http://off.dynu.net:8008](http://off.dynu.net:8008) - I maintain my own server, where I host and manage applications, rather than relying on SaaS providers. This setup includes a router running OpenWrt, which I use extensively for testing and learning. Working with constrained systems in general has given me insights into developing and refining various performance optimization techniques, such as efficient resource allocation, lightweight software solutions, and simplified configurations. These practices, honed in constrained environments, not only maximize the potential of smaller systems, but also provide valuable insights and strategies that can be effectively applied to larger, more complex infrastructures.
