# My Personal Notes

Welcome to my random personal notes that I collect over time, on the most varied subjects, such as design and implementation of languages, theory, internals, computer architecture, machine learning, high performance processing, programming, cluster, containers, books, links, tips and tricks, curiosities and others.

The website is generated from plain text formatting files called [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) available in the directories. The static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a tool used to convert these Markdown files into the web pages you see. Some of the Markdown files are described in the text, while others appear only as menu items. For Jupyter Notebook files, Markdown files are automatically generated and also appear in the menu. It is important to note that there are many other files in the repository that do not appear on the website itself. To see them all, you can browse the repository directly.

## Some directories and files in this repository

(unsorted)

* [HPC](https://github.com/efurlanm/hpc) - repository containing my personal notes on High-Performance Computing (HPC). Efficient language design and implementation are crucial for HPC because they directly impact the performance, scalability, and usability of HPC applications. Languages designed specifically for HPC, such as domain-specific languages (DSLs), can optimize parallelism, manage complex computations, and provide abstractions that simplify the development of high-performance code. Additionally, well-designed compilers and interpreters for these languages can further enhance performance by optimizing code execution on HPC systems.
* [Cluster/](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/tree/main/src/cluster/) - notes on my personal home cluster.
* [PAPI/](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/tree/main/src/tools/papi/) - portable performance counter library and related infos.
* [SDumont/](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/tree/main/src/sdumont/) - my notes about the [Santos Dumont supercomputer](https://sdumont.lncc.br/machine.php).
* [IDRIS/](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/tree/main/src/IDRIS/) - directory containing the [MPI course](http://www.idris.fr/formations/mpi/), with many examples in F90, from the Institut du DÃ©veloppement et des Ressources en Informatique Scientifique (IDRIS).
* [Articles/](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/tree/main/src/articles/) - interesting articles that I collect over time.
* [Python](python/README.md) - my personal notes on Python-related topics that I find interesting.
* [Moving Forth](moving_forth/README.md) - my personal notes on Brad Rodriguez's Moving Forth.
* [Fortran](fortran/README.md) - my personal notes about Fortran, a high -level programming language that is historically linked to HPC due to its efficient handling of numerical and scientific calculations.
* [C](c/README.md) - directory with my personal notes on the C programming language, which has efficiency and the ability to directly manipulate hardware resources, allowing optimized performance for compute-intensive tasks. 
* [Assembly](assembly/README.md) - my personal notes on the Assembly programming language.
* [Vintage](vintage/vintage.md) - vintage computer internals.
* [Courses](learning/courses.md) - list of courses I took at INPE.
