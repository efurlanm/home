implicit none (external | type) (Fortran 2018)

## `implicit none (type)`

- Is the same as the existing `IMPLICIT NONE` .

- If an `IMPLICIT NONE` or `IMPLICIT NONE (TYPE)` appears, there must be no other `IMPLICIT` statements in the scoping unit.

- No more than one `IMPLICIT NONE` statement shall appear in a scoping unit.

- `IMPLICIT INTEGER (I-N), REAL (A-H, O-Z)` : represents the default typing as specified by the Fortran Standard for names when they are not explicitly typed.

## `implicit none (external)`

- Means that any references to an external procedure must be to a name that is explicitly declared to have the `EXTERNAL` attribute. In other words, no implicit interfaces.
- If an `IMPLICIT NONE (EXTERNAL)` statement appears in a scoping unit, all dummy procedures and external procedures in that scope or a contained scope of BLOCK must have an accessible explicit interface or be declared `EXTERNAL`.
- As long as they are explicitly declared as procedures, procedures can have an implicit interface.
- External procedure or module must be explicity declared.
- Helps avoid hard-to-detect errors.
- Requires that the names of external and dummy procedures are explicitly declared as having the `external` attribute.
- The declaration can be made by:
    - *external* statement
    - *external* attribute in a type declaration statement
    - *procedure* declaration statement
    - *interface* block


## gfortran -fimplicit-none -Werror=implicit-interface

gfortran has the equivalent flags `-fimplicit-none` and `-Werror=implicit-interface` which allows not to use `implicit none (external | type)` directly in each code written, allowing for simpler and cleaner code. Perhaps the only restriction on the use of flags is when there is a need to use or merge some legacy code.


```python
%%writefile a.f90

subroutine a(x)
    integer :: x
    x = 345
end

program main
    ! implicit none (type, external)  ! a() must be explicitly declared

    ! external a     ! or:
    ! procedure() a  ! or:
    ! procedure() :: a

    integer :: x

    call a(x)
    print*, x
end
```

    Overwriting a.f90



```python
! gfortran a.f90 && ./a.out
```

             345



```python
! gfortran -fimplicit-none -Werror=implicit-interface -fno-diagnostics-show-option a.f90 && ./a.out
```

## `implicit none` as compiler flag (not 2018 specific)


```python
%%writefile a.f90
program main
    print*, a()
contains
    integer function a()
        a = 123
    end
end
```

    Overwriting a.f90



```python
!gfortran -fimplicit-none -Wall -Wextra -std=f2018 a.f90 && ./a.out
```
